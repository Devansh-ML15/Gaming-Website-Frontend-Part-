# Gaming-Website-Frontend-Part-
>Esports is a gaming company where they arrange Esports competitions for various prize money.
>Esports have designed a gaming website for their company. But sometimes they lack behind to share basic information to their customers where there is no need for contact support. >So they have designed a Q and A section using Microsoft Azure QnA maker service. Using these service they have uploaded some basic question and answers which will help their customers to get basic information about the company.

Steps of this project:
1> I made knowledge base on azure portal.
2> I had inserted some questions and answers in my knowledge base
3> I created a web app bot which will answer the questions asked from customers.
4> I had inserted my web app bot to my web application.
